# TCP-client-server
This is project in which I had to create a TCP client-server application, that will support synchronizing folders between different PC's and different users.
Each user has it's own ID and can run 1 instance of the program on each PC on a selected folder. Whenever 2 PC's that share the same user ID make a change to the shared folder, the application synchonizes the change.
